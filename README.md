I've never used Python for a personal project before, so step one for me is going to be relearning the basics.  I've signed up for a Treehouse account and will be completing one course per day until I'm able to manage it on my own.

####2) Consider a few approaches to the spec
####3) Determine the available tools that can help with some of these approaches
####4) Hook it all up
