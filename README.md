##John Lazzarini

I'm going to take a quick refresher on web development fundamentals before I take on this project.  I want it to meet industry standards, so I've signed up for a Treehouse account to relearn the ropes.

###Plan of Attack

####2) Consider a few approaches to the spec
####3) Determine the available tools that can help with some of these approaches
####4) Hook it all up
