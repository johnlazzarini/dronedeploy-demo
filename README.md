#DroneDeploy
##John Lazzarini

I'm going to take a quick refresher on web development fundamentals before I take on this project.  I want it to meet industry standards, so I've signed up for a Treehouse account to relearn the ropes.

###Plan of Attack

####1) Relearn some web development fundamentals. [x]
####2) Build the DroneDeploy "Hello, world!" and design the Frontend (whiteboarding) [x]
####2) Check out the DroneDeploy tile API* [x]
####3) Download the construction site sample and experiment with the newly repaired tile API documentation example. [x]
#####) Find a way to add tiles to an invisible HTML canvas [ ]
#####) Format the canvas into a coherent image [ ] 
#####) Create a button that, when clicked, downloads the canvas as a pdf [ ]

(The documentation for tile had a couple of errors in it.  I wrote a forum thread about it and the issue was promptly resolved by a developer.)
